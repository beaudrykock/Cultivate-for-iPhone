	<update>The VegVan is back up and running as of January 17, 2013. This is a modified winter schedule, so we're stopping at fewer places but for longer. Several stops haven't been confirmed yet, but right now we're stopping at the Rusty Bicycle (Magdalen Road) and the Railway Station. Check back for future updates!</update>
